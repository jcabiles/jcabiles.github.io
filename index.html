<p>In this blog post, I will explain the components of the cheat sheet that I created in Excel to help me win (2nd place) in fantasy basketball. If you haven't already, it might be a good idea to at least skim <a href="https://jcabiles.github.io/fantasy-basketball-cheat-sheet-part-1-an-introduction-to-fantasy-basketball.html">the first post I wrote in this series</a>.  Part 1 explains what fantasy basketball is, how to beat it, and how this cheat sheet helped me get closer to winning.</p>
<h2>My Fantasy Basketball Cheat Sheet</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11-x8N2TBA3emMWq_4gxoa8d_MbVdc4Cb2gBIBSpJ2rg/edit?usp=sharing">Here is a link to the cheat sheet I used for fantasy basketball</a>.  </p>
<p>In <a href="https://jcabiles.github.io/fantasy-basketball-cheat-sheet-part-1-an-introduction-to-fantasy-basketball.html">Part 1</a>, I mentioned my strategy for picking players up off the waiver wire or in free agency: <em>If a player gives me a boost in a statistical category, then I’d consider picking him up, as long as he doesn’t hurt me too badly in another category.</em></p>
<p>If you look at <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11-x8N2TBA3emMWq_4gxoa8d_MbVdc4Cb2gBIBSpJ2rg/edit?usp=sharing">the cheat sheet</a>, you'll get a sense of how I did that.  Each row represents a team on my fantasy league, while each column represents a statistical category.  Every cell basically gives each team a ranking that represents how well that team did in a specific statistical category.  For example, in cell B2, we see that <em>#WINNING</em> had the 2nd best field goal percentage in the league while B9 shows that <em>Libre Yun Nachos</em> had the worst (12th) field goal percentage in the league.</p>
<p>If you look at Row 3, you'll see that my team (highlighted in orange) was 5th in FG%, 2nd in FT%, 5th in three-pointers made, etc.  Totally making excuses here, but my 3PTM rank was higher before Curry got injured :-(</p>
<p>So how was this cheat sheet useful?  What I would do is look at players who were available in free agency or on the waiver wire and I would estimate how they would impact me in each statistical category.  <strong>The goal is to add a player who would boost as many categories as possible, but <em>be willing to punt my weakest categories</em> </strong>.</p>
<p>Why is that a winning strategy?  Because it's not realistic to be top ranking in ALL categories.  Russell Westbrook racks up a lot of rebounds and assists, but he's notoriously inefficient.  Guards like Stephen Curry or James Harden will boost your FG%, FT%, and 3PTM but they're going to hurt you in Blocks and Turnovers (guards are usually turnover-prone).  But as long as your team has a relatively high rank in at least half of the stat categories (ideally more), you'll have a pretty good shot to beat most teams.</p>
<h2>My Ranking Formula</h2>
<p>The ranking formula I used to rank the teams in each category is shown below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>=RANK((VLOOKUP($A2,&#39;Raw Totals&#39;!$A$2:$J$13,COLUMN(B1),FALSE)),&#39;Raw Totals&#39;!B$2:B$13)
</pre></div>


<p>We see two important Excel functions: RANK and VLOOKUP.  We also see the COLUMN function, which is something I used to make it easier to copy the formula to other cells.  (I'll explain this later, but basically the VLOOKUP function's third argument doesn't automatically increment itself.  The COLUMN function remedied this annoying issue).</p>
<p>We also see the $ sign in parts of this formula.  The $ signifies "absolute value".  In Excel (or Google Sheets), when you copy a formula from one cell to another, Excel automatically increments it.  The $ sign ensures that the column (represented by capital letters) or row (represented by numbers) won't be incremented.  For example, $A2 tells Excel: if I copy this formula to other cells, you can change the row value in the formula but <em>do not</em> change the column value... make sure the formulas always have Column A in that part of the argument.</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>I played fantasy basketball for the first time this past NBA season.  Despite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZf9NFaCQHQ">Charles Barkley's negative opinion on sports analytics</a>, I thought it would be worthwhile to use data analysis tools to help me make my fantasy team more competitive.</p>
<p>I won 2nd place in my fantasy league, so …</p>
